# startpage
A simple startpage (customizable i guess? (prepare to suffer tho))

background from the (now difunct) catppuccin/wallpapers repo

this was made to actually see if i could do some more "complex" stuff on html/css other than the "hello world" stuff (it does not feature js because that looks too hard)

you require the [JetBrainsMono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) for this

<sup>yes i made the README.md like 1 year later because i made the repo public when adding this</sup>
